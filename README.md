This repository is created for demo purposes only.


## How to install 



1. Navigate to the infra/terraform folder and create file terraform.tvars
with following format 
#aws_access_key         = "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
#aws_secret_key         = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
aws_region             = "us-east-1"
instance_type          = "t2.micro"
availability_zone      = "us-east-1a"
cloudflare_api_token   = ""
cloudflare_zone_name   = "belajar-affiliate.com"
cloudflare_record_name = "www"
cloudflare_account_id  = ""
cloudflare_zone_id     = ""

fill value with your own settings

2. Run the command terraform init

3. Run the command terraform plan to preview the changes

4. Run the command terraform apply to deploy. This will deploy to the configured cloud provider and add a DNS record to the registered domain.

5. Add the target instance to the target group

6. The website will be accessible at: www.belajar-affiliate.com

7. Setup SSL from cloudflare to ALB to access via HTTPS

7. Run the command terraform destroy to tear down the infrastructure



Notes:

Replace terraform.tfvars with your own settings.
After running terraform destroy, donâ€™t forget to delete the DNS entry in Cloudflare to avoid issues when redeploying.


Terraform will perform the following actions:
